It is a REDBUS calander chanllege given by the Naveen Automations labs, and I have successfully completed the challange. 

- Fetch only weekend [Sat/Sun] dates from the current month and future months (date calendar)

- Don't include past weekend date

- Finally get all weekend dates of a month and validate it

- Fetch the count of holidays of the given month and validate it

- If today's date is also a weekend date, include that as well.

- Use only CSS selector [No XPATH]
